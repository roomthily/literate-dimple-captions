Using socket.io and [opened-captions](https://github.com/slifty/opened-captions) for some near real-time sentiment analysis of CSPAN. Spoiler, it's pretty neutral most of the time.

### visualization tests

for some earlier visualization options, go to [viz-tests](https://literate-dimple.glitch.me/viz-tests.html) for binpacking (but not space-filling!):

Uses [js-word-packing](https://github.com/seveibar/js-word-packing) for the visualization.
